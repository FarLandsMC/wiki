# Pocket World

The pocket world is a world that resets every two weeks with a different
seed.  This allows players to gather large amounts of materials without
messing up the terrain.  It also allows players to explore with a lower
chance of things already being raided.

## Restrictions

Due to the fact that it's not for living in, there's a few restrictions
that we've placed on the world.

- No portals can be opened
- Claims can not be created
- Your spawn point will not be set by sleeping
    - You can still sleep to pass the night

## Resetting

The pocket world resets automatically every two weeks.

When it resets, the following things happen:

- All homes are deleted
- All players are moved to spawn
- A new seed is chosen randomly
- The world generates
- The spawn is placed
