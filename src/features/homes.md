# Homes

You can set homes for you to teleport back to!  The number of homes that
you have depends on your rank.  See [ranks](../ranks.md) for more
information.

The commands for setting a home are shown [below](#homes-commands).

If you don't have a home and you sleep in a bed, a home called `home`
will be automatically placed at your new respawn point so you can get
back there.
