# FarLands Ranks

Our server has many ranks, all of which can be seen below.

Our ranks can be divided into four categories: [playtime ranks](#playtime-ranks), [specialty
ranks](#specialty-ranks), [donor ranks](#donor-ranks), and [staff ranks](#staff-ranks).

## Playtime Ranks

There are seven ranks which can be earned by playing on the server.
These are referred to as "playtime ranks".  Each of these ranks requires
some amount of playtime and an advancement.

At any given time, you can see the pending requirements for rankup with
`/rankup`. This will show the advancement and the remaining amount of
playtime that you need.

Each time you vote for the server, the time requirement goes down by 1
hour.

### All Playtime Ranks

This table shows the playtime ranks and their requirements.

## Donor Ranks

These ranks are gained by making a donation to the server.  Donations
are not required, but are _greatly_ appreciated! To read more about
donations, see the [Donations](./welcome/donations.md) page.

All donor ranks have all commands from the [playtime ranks](#playtime-ranks),
with the addition of a few new commands.

A brief summary of the ranks is shown in the table below.  For more

## {{#rank media}} Rank

The media rank is a special rank which is crated to those who stream
and/or create videos on YouTube, Twitch, and other platforms.

The requirements for this rank are as follows:

- You need to be monetized by YouTube/Twitch
- You need to be at least {{#rank knight}} rank
- Put out at least one MC video a month and/or 1 MC stream a week on
  FarLands
- follow all FarLands rules in videos and streams while representing the
  server. 
- the commands are to be used for making videos and not when you are
  off-camera

If you stream regularly, but are having difficulty getting monetized,
staff may consider approving the rank for qualifying players.
This decision will happen internally by staff, and we will contact you
if we think you are eligible.

If you think you meet the criteria, but are unsure, you are welcome to
message a staff member or ask in `#help` on the [Discord](./welcome/discord.md).

Please do not over advertise your streams or vidoes.  On the [Discord](./welcome/discord.md),
you may use the `#media` channel to post your stream or video.  Do _NOT_
solicit people for subscriptions/views/etc on the server or in DMs.

Breaking these rules and requirements (such as trolling with the /vanish
command) risks losing the rank and if severe misuse the loss of ability
to receive the rank ever again.

## Staff Ranks

We have 5 full staff ranks and 3 junior staff ranks.  The ranks have
different purposes and duties, but they are all responsible for
moderating the server.

For information about our staff ranks, see [Staff](./welcome/staff.md).
