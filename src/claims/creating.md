# Creating a Claim

There are two ways to create a claim: using a [claim shovel](#claim-shovel) or the
[`/claim` command](#claim-command)

## Claim Shovel

1. Get a golden shovel.  This can be done by crafting or with the
   `/shovel` command.
1. Go to the first corner of your claim
1. Right click on a block, it doesn't matter which one
    - _Note: Don't take the claim shovel out of your hand before you
       click the other corner._
1. Go to the opposite corner of your claim
1. Right click on a block, it doesn't matter which one
1. Now you have a claim!

## `/claim` command

The `/claim` command is pretty simple, the usage is

```
/claim [radius] [name]
```

Where
- `[radius]` is any number for the radius of the claim that you wish to
  make
    - If not specified, it will create a 10x10 claim
- `[name]` is the name of the claim
    - If not specified, it will not be named

## Subclaims

A subclaim can be made by using the claim shovel in a claim.  See [Claim
Shovel](#claim-shovel) for a guide on making a claim with the claim
shovel.  Once you've created the subclaim, the borders should be white
instead of gold.
