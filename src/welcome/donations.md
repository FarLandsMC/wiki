# Donations

Donations are processed through Tebex.

Donations are not required, but are truly appreciated!

All donations go towards paying for server related bills.

All donations are final -- no refunds will be issued.

All donations are cumulative.  This means that if you donate 10 USD now
for the <rank class="donor"> rank and donate 20 USD later, you'll be
ranked up to <rank class="patron">.

You can donate [here](https://farlandsdonations.tebex.io).

View the donor ranks and their perks [here](../ranks.md#donor-ranks).
