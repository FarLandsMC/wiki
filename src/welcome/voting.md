# Voting

Voting for the server helps to increase our ranking on the server lists
and thus improve the amount of people that we get.  This makes the
community bigger and better!

In order to encourage voting, for each vote a player will receive 1
diamond, three emeralds, two steak, and 5 levels.

## Vote Parties

Every 15 votes, a vote party occurs, giving every player on the server a
random item from a selection of 88 choices.

The options range anywhere from logs all the way to a netherite
chestplate.
