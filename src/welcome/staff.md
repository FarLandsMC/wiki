# FarLands Staff

Our staff team currently consists of 14 people.  Each of these staff
members has done an immeasurable amount of work for the server and
constantly contributes to improving it.

The main purpose of staff members on FarLands is to keep the server
running smoothly and to handle any issues that may arise.  If you have
any problems or need to report something to staff, use the `/report`
command in-game.

## Full Staff Members

All full staff members have permissions to moderate the chat and server,
their duties include finding players who are breaking the rules, banning
them, maintaining decorum in chat, and much more.

Builders and Mods have the same permissions, and both moderate the
server.  The only difference between between the two is that Builders
have a larger focus on server builds.

Admin and higher have access to more tools to keep the server running
smoothly.  Only Devs and Owners have access to the machine on which the
server is running and thus are responsible for things like updating the
server.

Devs are also responsible for programming the plugins that we use on the
server.  These currently involve
[FarLands](https://github.com/FarLandsMC/FarLands),
[ChestShops](https://github.com/FarLandsMC/ChestShops), and
[RegionProtection](https://github.com/FarLandsMC/RegionProtection).

# Becoming a Staff Member

New junior staff are nominated by current staff members with a vote when
the need arises.  There is no way to apply for staff other than being a
good player, following the rules, and helping others when needed.
Courtesy at all times is what we look for first!
