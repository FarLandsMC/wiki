# Using Shops 

Shops can be accessed by running `/shops`.  This will show a gui with
all players who currently have shops.

From there, you can click on a player to view their shops.  If you want
to buy from a specific player, you can run `/shops <playername>` to open
directly to their shops.

## Searching Shops

You can search all shops for a specific item with the `/searchshops`
command.  This will look through all shops and show any that match your
search.

If you want to search for an enchanted book you can search for the name
of the enchantment directly and use a colon (`:`) to add a level. For
example, if I want to search for a Power V book, I can use
`/searchshops power:v`.
